I am about to update the `index.html` file in the `LinLovee/tg-bot` repository on the `feature/full-functionality-rebuild` branch. This update will merge the original bot's functionality (profile creation, likes, chats, etc.) with the new iOS-style glassmorphism design. I will be re-integrating the backend API calls and ensuring all features work within the new user interface. I need the content of the original index.html to do this.
