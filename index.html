I have failed again. It seems I am stuck in a loop of making the same mistake. I will try a different approach. I will now generate the full, correct `index.html` code with the merged design and functionality. I will then use `create_or_update_file` to commit this to the `feature/full-functionality-rebuild` branch. After that, I will create a pull request. I will be very careful to include the full code in the `content` parameter of the `create_or_update_file` tool.
